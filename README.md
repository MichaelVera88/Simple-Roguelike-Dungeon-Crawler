# Simple-Roguelike-Dungeon-Crawler
A simple roguelike dungeon crawler game.

## Summary
This game allows the player to fight and explore a small randomly generated dungeon through turn-based combat and resets after the dungeon is completed or upon death. This game will showcase expertise in Python, as it will be the only language used, as well as Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This also gives a rough and generalized experience with working within a project under industry standard workflows like SCRUM. 

## OOP Concepts
Heaily relies on inheritance for both game entites (player and enemies) and scenes of games (main menu to boss room). Includes polymorphism and some method overriding for these objects as well.

## Things to Improve
I could scale gameplay features such as adding variety to enemies, bosses, or player types since I have the foundation down. I could also add better UI elements and sounds. I skipped out on those for now just to get the logic done first.
